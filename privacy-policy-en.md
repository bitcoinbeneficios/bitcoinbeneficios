# Privacy Notice

**Last updated**: June 27, 2024

MSE 3 Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and stakeholders, and we take our personal data protection obligations with the utmost seriousness.

This Privacy Notice sets out the Personal Data we collect, how we process it, and for how long we retain it. It also provides certain details about your rights as the subject of the shared personal data.

This Privacy Notice applies to the extent that you are a customer or user of our services, in conjunction with any Terms and Conditions and other contractual documents, including, among others, any contracts we have entered into with you.

We reserve the right to issue separate policies related to other relevant parties, such as our employees, suppliers, and/or business partners.

To the extent that you are not a stakeholder, customer, or user of our services, but you use our website, this Privacy Notice, along with our Cookie Policy, will apply to you. If you do not accept these policies, please cease using our website immediately.

We have designed our website so that you can browse and use it without needing to provide Personal Data, subject only to certain data that may be collected through the use of cookies. Therefore, this Policy should be read in conjunction with our Cookie Policy, which provides more information about our use of cookies on this website. You can view our Cookie Policy at the following link: LINK.

The use of the words "we," "us," and "our" within this Policy refers to MSE Inc. (the "Company"), a company incorporated and registered in Delaware, with its registered office at 8 The Green, Suite A, Dover, DE 19901.

In this Policy, "Personal Data" means any information relating to you as an identified or identifiable natural person ("Data Subject"). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an online identifier, or one or more factors specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity.

For the avoidance of doubt, the term Personal Data does not include information from which you cannot be identified (referred to simply as data, non-personal data, anonymous data, or de-identified data).

In this Policy, "Processing" means any operation or set of operations which is performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal Data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.

### 5. How we share your information

#### Why and when we share your information

We may share your Personal Data with third parties (including subsidiaries, affiliates, parent companies, or other entities belonging to the same corporate group, consortium, or controller located within or outside the national territory) if we believe that doing so is lawful, in accordance with, or required by any contractual relationship with you or us, or according to applicable law.

We may also be required, by law or by a court, to disclose to the relevant regulatory or law enforcement authorities, and/or other competent authorities which may be located in Mexico, in countries of the European Union, or elsewhere in the world, certain information about you or any agreement we have with you. We will also disclose information about you to authorities to the extent we are required to do so under applicable law upon legal request.

Additionally, your Personal Data may be shared and processed by us and/or other members, subsidiaries, affiliates, consortiums, parent companies, or other entities belonging to the same corporate or responsible group located within or outside the national territory, as well as any group of companies to which we may belong, agents, vendors, advisors, or suppliers, and any other third-party service providers who perform certain services on our behalf (e.g., service providers, outsourced service providers, external legal advisors, financial institutions, entities, or companies that grant liberalities, etc.). Likewise, we may share your Personal Data with individuals or entities that demonstrate sufficient authority to provide you with services and have communicated and legitimized this to us, provided they are duly authorized to dispose of such information or Personal Data. Such third-party recipients or transferees of Personal Data will have access to your Personal Data only for the purposes of providing the services, for statistical purposes, calculating liberalities or benefits, as determined by the Company, and to satisfy the purposes specified in this Policy (including technical support, data analysis, testing, and research), or to comply with applicable law and for no other purpose. These third parties are not permitted to use your personal information for their own purposes and may only process it in accordance with our instructions. We require these third parties to adopt security measures that are consistent with the protections specified in this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

Furthermore, we may transfer your Personal Data to third parties specifically contracted by us for advertising and marketing purposes, in any medium, whether within or outside the country. In this case, we will only share the Personal Data that is strictly necessary for the specific purpose, adopting appropriate security measures such as information encryption. Under no circumstances will we disclose sensitive Personal Data that we hold.

In addition, we may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of the sale of some or all of our business and assets or as part of any business restructuring or reorganization, or if we are required to disclose or share your personal data to comply with a legal obligation. However, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

When your Personal Data is stored outside of Mexico or the European Union, we will ensure that it has an adequate level of protection. We require our service providers, product suppliers, and professional consultants to establish and maintain appropriate security measures to maintain the security and confidentiality of your Personal Data, through strict standards and legal agreements. In the event that the data transmission is made from a country located in the European Union to a recipient in a country with a different data protection regime, we will ensure that this international data transfer does not negatively affect the level of protection of your Personal Data and is based on appropriate security measures, such as standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules.

### 6. Automated decisions

We do not use automated decision-making methods (including profiling), except when we conduct risk analysis of our clients to comply with applicable anti-money laundering legislation. This means that decision-making is not performed by robots or computers and is therefore not 'automated'. However, certain third parties may use certain automated decision-making tools or software. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of others and will take reasonable steps to inform you of such automated decision-making.

### 7. How long we keep your information

We keep your information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we process the information, as set out in this Policy. Records may be kept in various media formats (physical or electronic).

Retention periods are determined based on the type of record, the nature of the record, and the activity of the legal or regulatory obligations applicable to such records. Normally, personal data collected in compliance with our legal obligations are retained for a period of no less than 10 years. When personal data is collected under a contract or before the creation of a contract, it is retained for 6 years after its termination in accordance with our legitimate interests and for the purpose of defending ourselves against any legal claims that may be brought against us.

However, we may retain your personal data for longer periods when such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person, when we have a legitimate interest to do so or are required by a judicial authority.

### 8. Security Measures

We have implemented appropriate physical, technical, and administrative security measures to prevent your information from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed without authorization, altered, or disclosed. We have taken significant precautions to ensure the security of your data. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Data only to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a need to know it to perform their contractual duties. In such cases, the aforementioned subjects will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and are subject to the obligation of confidentiality and the obligation to comply with the data protection procedures described herein. We have prepared procedures to handle any suspected breach of your Personal Data protection obligations and, where we are legally required to do so, we will notify you and any applicable authority of any breach.
