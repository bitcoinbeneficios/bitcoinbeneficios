This Policy establishes how cookies and similar technologies are used on our website and the purposes for which we use them. This Cookie Policy, in conjunction with our Privacy Notice, will be applicable to the extent that you use our website. If you do not accept these policies, please immediately suspend the use of our website. You can consult our Privacy Notice at [Cookies Policy](http://bitcoinbeneficios.com/en/cookie-policy).

The references and uses of the words "we," "us," and "our" within this Policy refer to **MSE Inc. ("Company" or "MSE," interchangeably)**, a company incorporated and registered under the laws of Delaware.

This information tells us about the pages you click on or the hardware you are using, but not your name, age, address, or any other personal data that we could use to identify you.

By using our website, in accordance with this Cookie Policy, you consent to the storage and access of cookies and other technologies on your device. If you do not agree with the above, you can update the settings of your web browser and/or your web browsing device to block or delete cookies, but please be aware that doing so may affect the way this and other websites are displayed on your device(s), as well as the functioning of such websites.

### 1. What are cookies

Las cookies son una función del software del navegador web que le permite a los servidores web reconocer la computadora o el dispositivo empleado para acceder a un determinado sitio web. Una cookie es un pequeño archivo de texto descargado en tu computadora o dispositivo móvil cuando visitas el sitio que le permite al sitio web recordar tus acciones y preferencias (tales como inicio de sesión, idioma, tamaño de fuente y otras preferencias de visualización) a lo largo del tiempo, para que no tengas que volver a ajustarlas cuando vuelvas al sitio web o navegues de una página a otra.

Existen dos diferentes formas de clasificar las cookies, conforme a su duración y por el dominio al que pertenecen.

**Según su duración, una cookie puede ser:**

- cookie de sesión, la cual se elimina cuando el usuario cierra el navegador; o
- cookie persistente, la cual se guarda en el disco duro y permanece en la computadora/dispositivo del usuario por un plazo predefinido.

**Según el tipo de dominio al que pertenece, una cookie es:**

- propias, que son creadas por el servidor del sitio visitado y comparte el mismo dominio (es decir, establecido por nosotros); o
- de terceros, creadas por un dominio distinto al dominio del sitio visitado.

### 2. What cookies we use

We use cookies created by us through our web developers (first-party cookies) as well as those created by third parties (third-party cookies). Cookies can also be classified according to their purpose. We use the following cookies for the following purposes:

**Analysis/Performance Cookies.** They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and see how visitors move around our website when they are using it, as well as the dates and times of their visits. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.

**Preference Cookies.** These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited, and the links you have followed, as well as the time you spent on our website, and the websites visited just before and just after visiting our website. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We will also share this information with third parties for the same purposes.

**Other technologies.** In general, on our website, we use cookies and other technologies (such as web server logs) to improve your experience and to gather information about how our website is used. This information is compiled and provides general, not individual-specific, information. Therefore, no part of this information is associated with you, and cookie-related information is not used to personally identify you, thus it is anonymized and not identified. The data collected is entirely under our control, and these cookies are not used for purposes other than those described here.

**Pixel tags – web beacons.** Pixel tags (also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels) are small pieces of code that can be embedded in websites and emails. Pixel tags will be used to learn how you interact with our website pages and emails so that we can provide you with a more personalized experience, for our own benefit and that of our users.

**Device identifiers.** A device identifier is a unique label used to identify a mobile device. Device identifiers are used to track, analyze, and improve the performance of websites and the ads displayed on them.

**Third-party services.** We may allow others to provide analytical services on our behalf. In addition to the use of cookies described above, these entities may use other methods to collect information about your use of our website and other online sites and services, such as the technologies described below.

We also use other services, such as Google Analytics (described below) or other third-party cookies, to help us analyze the performance of our website.
